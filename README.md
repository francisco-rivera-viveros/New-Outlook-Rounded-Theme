I was boring at my call center job and I though I can use inspect tool from edge to actually change here an there  a lil bit of the Outlook UI then I started this project in a couple days I became passionate about creating my very own version of the Outlook UI mainly rounded corners ans some colors! soo I just became absolutely obsessed with idea and I fell in love with it !! 

tbh I was mad I didn't find any extension on Microsoft/Chrome web Store for Outlook so I was like I'm going to spend like 9 hours on my work looking at Outlook soooo I would like to change a couple of things to make it feel comfortable , great and nice!  Hold on..



Let's clarify this I used to be the person who always loooked for some-else mods like some programmer that would release some extension for your PC and then I realized I was soo obssesed with that , that I really will like to create my own things and personalize or have certain custom mods on my pc 

soo since no one did it I was like welll maybe I can code it myself and if fact I was able to create some crazy ideas that might not be for everyone but I loved them and I think that's what I care cause you know I'm making this custom mods for me not for anyone else but I'm willing to share it cause you know , 

when I used to be just a user and I found a really nice extension or mod I was like thank god , god bless this programmm for this amazing work! so I thinking about it and I was like well maybe someone would like it and I will love to contriubute to my beautiful online community I feel like I already receive so It's my time to give to others!! and it fell really great!!




May be they aren't perfect or super useful but in anyway I love them!!! and maybe i thinks that's what matter most!

And happy to share and see it's really original cause no one else have done it plus there's real people on the other side of the world that Idk and they like it too and that's soo great to know that someone likes the idea too!!!

I think that's what fills me with joy the most!

This is how it looks like!!
